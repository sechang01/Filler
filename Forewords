Many people are asking, “What are the seven deadly sins?” The seven deadly sins viewed
by society and literature are:
• Lust (Luxuria in Latin) – to have an intense desire or need: “But I tell you that
anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in
his heart” (Matthew 5:28).
• Gluttony (Gula in Latin) – excess in eating and drinking: “for drunkards and
gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags” (Proverbs 23:21).
• Greed (avaritia in Latin)- excessive or reprehensible acquisitiveness: “Having lost
all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in
every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more” (Ephesians 4:19).
• Laziness (Acedia in Latin) – disinclined to activity or exertion: not energetic or
vigorous: “The way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns, but the path of the
upright is a highway” But it is mostly about the Laziness of the soul, boredom, to
walk away from God, prayers. (Proverbs 15:19).
• Wrath (Ira in Latin) – Also known as Anger. Strong vengeful anger or indignation:
“A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger” (Proverbs
15:1).
• Envy (Invidia in Latin) – painful or resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed
by another joined with a desire to possess the same advantage: “Therefore, rid
yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.
Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in
your salvation” (1 Peter 2:1-2).
• Pride (superbia in Latin)- quality or state of being proud – inordinate self esteem:
“Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall” (Proverbs 16:18).
